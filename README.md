# GROUND_STATION_MAVSDK_C
Code to run on the ground station. The ground station is a computer on the ground through which the important waypoints of the mission (and the waypoint types) can be input into the UAV. The UAV then handles the detail. The ground station also has code to perform pre fligth checks, without these checks completing successfuly the UAV will never launch. There is code block that displays any ground markers that have been found. A seperate software will also be launched on the ground station called QGround control. This has nothing to do with this repository but is an essential tool in monitoring the UAV perfromance during flight..
